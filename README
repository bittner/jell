Jell (Unofficial)
-----------------

Jell makes daily standups work for remote teams. Keep your team up to
date, share plans and progress every day — without another meeting.

Jell is a free service for teams. It's available from https://jell.com
and integrates nicely with Slack (a team chat you either use already, or
you should consider using — it's free too).

This web app is not affiliated with Jell. The Jell name, associated
trade marks and the Jell logo are trade marks of Jell or related
entities.
